Plant Controller with Online Learning and Performance Visualization

This script provides an implementation of a control system targeting a plant. It follows these steps:

Dependencies: Imports necessary packages like TensorFlow, NumPy, and scikit-learn.
Input Functions:
get_next_input(): Fetches the next input to the plant.
get_desired_coordinates(): Gets the desired output coordinates for the plant.
Controller Setup:
A Neural Network model is used to act as the controller.
The model comprises several dense layers interleaved with dropout layers.
Utilizes an ExponentialDecay learning rate for the optimizer.
Online Training Loop:
A loop runs to train the controller in real-time using the errors between desired and actual outputs.
The output from the plant and errors (along the x, y, z coordinates) are recorded for visualization.
Visualization:
Multiple plots are generated showing:
Plant output over time.
Errors along x, y, and z coordinates separately.
Total error across iterations.
This controller aims to minimize the error between the plant's actual output and the desired output using the feedback mechanism.
